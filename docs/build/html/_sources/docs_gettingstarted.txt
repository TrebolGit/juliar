Getting It Onto Your Webpage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. After downloading juliar, unzip it with a zip file and put it into your project folder. 

2. If you are a Windows user, Juliar comes prepackaged with a simple windows server and all you need to do is launch "Juliar Server.exe".

3. If you are a Linux user, you can put Juliar files into your apache2 folder.

4. If you are a Mac user or you don't want to use Juliar server, download a XAMPP server, it should run on any system and be compatible with Juliar.

.. note: Any server that can pass HTML is compatible...so virtually any server should work..

5. Open up "index.html" in your preferred editor (such as notepad.exe) and at the top of the file add ``<script src="juliar.js"></script>`` This will import Juliar language.

3. In the next line under add the tags ``<juliar></juliar>`` (This will create space where juliar code can be ran)

4. Start adding your code inside the juliar tags!

.. note: The ``<ijuliar></ijuliar>`` tags are for the interpretor. If you wish to allow users to try out the language themself you can add that tag to your page.
